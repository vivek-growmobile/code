This folder contains my implementation of the hash map challenge in python.
To run the program just run the command:
> python kpcb_challenge.py

The main method has a simple test where it adds 4 elements to a size 4 hashmap, forcing it to rehash. It also prints the map at every stage and indicates which step caused it to rehash.

You can test it more by setting more to the map or getting more from the map, you can also play around with the rehash factor that I added as an optional constructor argument.
